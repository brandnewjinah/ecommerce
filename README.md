# Full Stack E-commerce Project

This is my attempt to create a full stack e-commerce platform.<br><br>
With my background in UX/UI design, I hope to build highly customizable UI components that are easy to implement and elegantly designed.<br><br>

## Backend

I used Node.js to create models and routes for

- Registering a user
- Logging in a user
- Getting user info
- Creating a new product
- Getting product(s)
- Updating a product
- Deleting product(s)
- Cart and order to be updated soon

## CMS

I created a CMS for admins to easily

- Upload a new product
- Update product(s)
- Delete product(s)
- View all users
- Option to promote/suspend a user to be updated soon

## Frontend

I created a simple e-commerce layout where users can register, shop and checkout items.
